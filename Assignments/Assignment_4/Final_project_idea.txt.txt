My final project would be from my research project relating to the molten salt nuclear reactor. Our research uses computational method to find the thermophysical property for the salt mixtures used in the reactor. I will present the data with the salt called LiFUF at different temperatures and show the relationship between volume equilibrium and pressure. The sources I will use is the data that I already have and the information from PPT that I used to present in conferences and events. The data would be a polynomial graph.
